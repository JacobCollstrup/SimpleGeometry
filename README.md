# SimpleGeometry
This project is created to help me understand and practice object oriented programming in the C# language.
As a chatered-surveyor I already know about geometry and basic geometric datatypes, so this was a natural go-to to practice how to declare classes and methods.
As I learn more and more, I'll expand this project with my new skills and incoorperate what makes sense for the project, this may include but is not limited to:
Interfaces, Unit testing, polymorphism, Lambda Expressions and exception handling.

Ideas for future code:
GeometricAnalysisUtilities - a class that implements basic geometric analysis, fx, line intersection, overlap between polygons and other datatypes.
A graphical userinterface with buttons that activates the above mentioned methods
Bufferanalysis
3d geometry classes
Coordinate analysis - a piece of maths that'll recognize what danish coordinate system the geometry is in.
